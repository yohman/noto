Students at Reitaku University are building a crisis map for the Noto Earthquake. Using a simple model, each student volunteers to "find" data relevant to the crisis, downloads, exlores, conducts geoprocessing in Python, and ultimately converts the data into a web-friendly geojson format. A customized web front end is built using MapboxGL's javascript API to visualize the cleaned up data and posted on GitHub pages for the public.
